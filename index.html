<h3 id="Musician">Chapter 1: Musician</h3>
<p>
At age 14 my family bought me a guitar for Christmas and paid for guitar lessons. I took to it head first 
and soon was attempting to find other musicians to form a band. During my high school years I played my 
first gigs with my band, Critical Insanity, in the St. Louis music scene. I also learned how to record 
demos using a 4 track, and we self released 2 demos. 
</p>
<div class="bottom p">
<p>
During my college years I formed the band, Misanthropic, who would go on to self release an album that 
caused a bit of buzz in the local metal scene. Afterwards I joined the band, Unburied, who received
attention on the national metal scene via the magazine, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Maniacs"><b>
<em>Metal Maniacs</b></em></a>, and the website <a href="http://www.blabbermouth.net/"><b>blabbermouth.net</b>
</a>. At the end of the day I played over 200 shows, engineered and self released about a dozen albums/demos 
and opened for some of my idols. Even though all of this was a blast it wasn't exactly an ATM, hence the 
next chapter.

<h3 id="Salesman">Chapter 2: Salesman</h3>
<p>
After all the smoke had cleared from my crazy days in various bands I settled down in the normal 9-5 
grind. I discovered I had a passion and a talent for salesmanship. From the book 
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sales-Bible-Ultimate-Resource/dp/B001946QLI/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr="><b>
<em>The Sales Bible</b></em></a> by Jeffrey Gitomer I learned the sales process of building rapport, qualifying a need, 
overcoming objections and finally closing the sale. I've explored this in various positions ranging from selling everything from 
musical gear, to firearms, to cars and everything else in between. 
</p>
<div class="bottom p">
<p>
I've been told "I can sell ice to an Eskimo" and one of the biggest car dealers in St. Louis refered to 
me as "Dale Carnegie's Grandson". It was a path that taught me a ton about human nature, taking care of 
your customers, goal setting and perservance. In fact it lead me to the next interesting an unexpected 
chapter.

<h3 id="Gun Enthusiast">Chapter 3: Gun Enthusiast</h3>
<p>
Even though I've been born and raised in the Midwest I've never really been in a family of hunters or 
shooters. With that said due to my sales experience I found myself with an AR-15 in each hand behind a 
sales counter slinging guns. I had just taken a position at a pawn shop who had recently been acquired by a national chain 
who specialized in firearms as well as the pawn business. This led to me essentially playing the 
role of Nicholas Cage in <b><em>Lord of War</em></b> albeit legally. Even though I hadn't even shot a gun in my life I 
became the top salesperson at my location.
</p>
<div class="bottom p">
<p>
Eventually I took over their online sales department via <a href="https://www.gunbroker.com/"><b>GunBroker</b></a> and ran it single 
handily. I grew the department to a average $40,000 in monthly sales and around $500,000 in yearly gross sales. Evidently that lead to 
my purchasing a Glock 19 9mm and Glock 22 .40 S&W as well as some father-son bonding by shooting at our favorite range 
<a href="https://www.sharpshooterstl.com/"><b>Sharpshooters</b></a> in St.Louis, MO.

<h3 id="Freemason">Chapter 4: Freemason</h3>
<p>
At said position I played a part in getting a former customer hired as a salesman. After work one evening 
my co-worker mentioned he was a Freemason. I expressed an interest in the fraternity based on my research 
into more let's say "esoteric" studies. Before I knew it I found myself behind the closed doors of  
<a href="http://kirkwoodmasoniclodge.com/"><b>Kirkwood Lodge No.484</b></a> able to count myself as a brother to some of histories most 
legendary gentlemen past and present.
</p>
<div class="bottom p">
<p>
Freemasonry is often misunderstood by the masses and mucked in conspiracy. At it's heart it is a beautiful 
system of morality, veiled in allegory, illustrated by signs and symbols with the aim to make good men 
better. It's assuring to know that I have a network of brothers that spans the entire world. And as of 
October 2018, pending the will of my brothers, I will obtain the 32nd degree at <a href="http://scottishrite-stl.org/aasr2/"><b>
The Scottish Rite - Valley of St. Louis.</b></a>

<h3 id="Entrepreneur">Chapter 5: Entrepreneur</h3>
<p>
From early efforts in the music industry to my days in the world of sales I've had the entrepreneurial 
spark. Said spark became a flame when I read the book 
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/B008BUHTLE/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr="><em>
<b>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</em></b></a> by Robert Kiyosaki and was inspired to start my 
own business. I formed Riverfront Tactical LLC and utilized eCommerrece to sell firearms accessories 
ranging from high-end optics to AR-15 parts. I've learned everything the hard way from marketing, 
inventory management, supply chain, taxes, legal, financials, etc. It has led to some crazy hours at 
times but nothing beats being your own boss. 
</p>
<div class="bottom p">
<p>
However, to truly be massively successful in business you must be able to scale the business. At 
the current time my business is at a nexus between Version 1.0 that is 100% dependent on me to Version 2.0 
that is automated using tech, outsources tasks to virtual assistants overseas and reinvests it's ALL of 
its profits back into the business. The type of business that generates passive income and that I can run from a sandy beach on Grand Turk.

<h3 id="Developer">Chapter 6: Developer</h3>
<p>
So where does learning to code via <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/"><b>LaunchCode</b></a> fall into the grand scheme of 
all of this? Well at the end of day what a person can achieve as a developer is only limited by their skill set, guts and imagination. 
Tech is the future and in 20 years self-driving cars, A.I., augmented reality, the block chain, etc. will 
be the norm. Honestly when that time comes not knowing how to code will be on par with being illiterate.
</p>
<p>
I'm personally learning to code so that I can implement it in my business by using code to automate 
repetitive tasks. I've yet to dig into the book <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/"><b><em>Automate 
the Boring Stuff with Python</em></b></a> by Al Sweigart, but I already know that web-scraping 
alone will increase my profits by strengthening the reaction time of my virtual supply chain.
</p>
<div class="bottom p">
<p>
Foremore by pursuing a job as a developer while maintaining a LLC I can reinvest the business profits 100% and max out 401k/Roth IRA 
contributions. When adding in the bonus of constantly keeping your brain sharp by learning new languages/
software, utilizing creative skills via front-end development and logic via back-end develpment you have a win-win-win.
